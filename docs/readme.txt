Use this folder, docs, to store documents, SQL files or other files necessary to 
understand or install the Gig Central CI application.

When saving SQL files, consider using a dated naming convention, for example:

1) create a folder named sql, inside this, the docs folder
2) create a dated SQL file, for example gig-central-06072014.sql

Thanks!
